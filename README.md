## About Me

🎓 I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Speech Processing. Right now, I'm working with [Thomas François](https://thomasfrancoisucl.wixsite.com/homepage) on the [iRead4Skill European Project](https://iread4skills.com/), developing tools to improve reading skills for adults! In my Phd, my research focused on the evaluation of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems under the supervision of 🏛 [Richard Dufour](https://cv.hal.science/richard-dufour), [Jane Wottawa](https://janewottawa.wordpress.com/) and [Mickael Rouvier](https://cv.hal.science/mickael-rouvier). Previously, I studied Cross-Lingual Embeddings and their evaluation methods with [Carlos Ramisch](https://pageperso.lis-lab.fr/carlos.ramisch/) and Manon Scholivet.

## Works

- 📊 One of the major implications of my work is the analysis of the impact of ASR hyperparameters on performances using diverse metrics. My research tends to show that metrics are not necessarily correlated at the [transcription](https://hal.science/hal-03712735/) and [system](https://hal.science/hal-04584931/) level.
- 🔍 I developed a [data set](https://hal.science/hal-04125590/) using 7,150 human choices which were annotated by 143 great people! This ✨open-access✨ data set can be used to evaluate rigorously ASR metrics so we can finally get rid of Word Error Rate. You are more than welcome to develop your own metric and to evaluate it on the HATS dataset using our [toolkit](https://github.com/thibault-roux/metric-evaluator) 🤗
- 💡 [MinED](https://univ-avignon.hal.science/hal-04615039/): a method to make semantic metrics as interpretable as Word Error Rate.
- 📡 Also, I contribute to and maintain [FABRA](https://cental.uclouvain.be/fabra/) on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/thibault-roux).
